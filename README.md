# Radiation Medical Exam MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to create a structured logging system for radiation medical examinations (6470/13 exams) used to monitor radiation workers in the Navy for signs and symptoms of cancer and to clear them for work around ionizing radiation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is a DEMO server and is NOT HIPAA compliant. DO NOT use this in actual medical practice or with real patient data.**

## Purpose

This MCP server provides tools for logging and managing radiation medical exam data, including:
- Structured data entry for 13 exam fields
- Note-taking capabilities for medical observations
- PDF documentation processing and search
- Summary generation for exam documentation
- Resource management for tracking exam records

## Features

### üìù Note Management
- Create and store medical examination notes
- Structured data entry with validation
- Real-time resource updates

### üìÑ PDF Documentation Integration
- **Automatic PDF Processing**: Extracts text content from radiation health documentation
- **Chapter-Specific Access**: Direct access to specific chapters (e.g., Chapter 2 procedures)
- **Full-Text Search**: Search through PDF content for specific terms, procedures, or regulations
- **Official Reference Material**: Includes Navy Radiation Health Protection Manual (NAVMED P-5055)

### üîç Advanced Search Capabilities
- Search across all PDF documentation
- Context-aware results with surrounding text
- Support for medical terminology and procedure names

## Components

### Resources
- **Note Resources**: Custom `note://` URI scheme for accessing individual exam notes
- **PDF Documents**: Full document access via `pdf://document/{filename}` URIs
- **Chapter Access**: Specific chapter content via `pdf://chapter/{filename}/{chapter_number}` URIs
- Each resource includes name, description, and content in text/plain format

### Prompts
- **summarize-notes**: Creates summaries of all stored exam notes
  - Optional "style" argument (brief/detailed) to control summary depth
  - Combines all current notes into a comprehensive exam summary
- **explain-procedure**: Explains radiation medical exam procedures from official documentation
  - Required "procedure" argument to specify which procedure to explain
  - References official Navy documentation for authoritative guidance

### Tools
- **add-note**: Adds new exam notes to the server
  - Required arguments: "name" and "content" (both strings)
  - Updates server state and notifies clients of resource changes
- **search-documentation**: Search through PDF documentation for specific terms
  - Required argument: "search_term" (string) - term to search for
  - Optional argument: "document" (string) - specific document to search
  - Returns matching content with context

## Documentation Integration

The server automatically processes PDF documents stored in `src/radiation_medical_exam/utils/instructions/`:

- **NAVMED P-5055**: Navy Radiation Health Protection Manual
- **Chapter 2**: Medical Examinations (specifically accessible)
- **Full-text search**: Across all available documentation
- **Contextual results**: Search results include surrounding text for better understanding

### Supported PDF Features
- Multi-page document processing
- Chapter extraction and parsing
- Full-text search with context
- Caching for improved performance
